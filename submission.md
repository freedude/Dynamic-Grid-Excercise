# Submission Notes 

These notes will be read by HubSpot developers. Drop us a line!

## Given more time, what would you have done differently?
1. Dropdowns
  - These currently display info from the data.json only
  - I Could have made them way more functional, applying proper filtering logic and adding/removing media items to the grid
  
2. Radio Buttons
  - They show and hide content, but if I used flexbox I feel I would have been able to re-order the content better as movies/books are added or removed
  
3. Media Grid
  -I used an Isotope Grid due to experience, but I would like to implement a full flex-box or css-grid solution
  
4. Use ES6 classes
  - Didn't spend enough time making my code modular, although I used ES6 features such as Arrow Functions and Promises, with a bigger application I would have used more classes. Should allow for multiple imnstances.
  
5. Use Axios Library or Fetch API 
  - I used XMLHttpRequest here as I find this quick to set up, but with more time I could have re-visted my Axios or Fetch knowledge to call the Testimonail API
  
5. Scss Sourcemaps
 - If I configured Sourcemaps I would be able to debug css code in the browser debugger more precisely
 
6. UX
  - Add loading indicators when the images are still loading or while a Chuck Norris quote is loading
  - Animate pressed button states
  - Mobile designs could be better with use of flexbox
  
7. SearchBox
  - Didn't find the time to implement search functionality that would display items based on their data-item tags!

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

I really enjoyed completing this code challenge despite not getting everything as functional as I would have liked. I mostly worked on this in the evening times after work and could have done with more time off to focus my attention, but once I got into it it became very addictive!

I am glad that I was well able to setup Webpack without any trouble and feel like I brought both excercises very close style wise to the Mockup images in the time I ha!
